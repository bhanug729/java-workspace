// An interface specifies a contract for classes to implement by focusing on capabilities rather than implementation.
// An interface canâ€™t be instantiated.
// All variables are implicitly declared as public, static and final (must be initialize).
// It cannot contain constructors.
// All methods are implicitly declared as public, abstract.
// Since Java 8,
	// Interfaces can include default methods with implementations.
	// Interfaces can include static methods, which belong to the interface itself rather than any instance.
// Since Java 9, interfaces can include private methods to encapsulate shared code between default methods, 
// helping to avoid code duplication within the interface.
